# Create a dataframe called 'unsolved' with one row per city that gives the total number #of homicides for the city and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the #disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”) 

unsolved <- spread(homicides, key = disposition, value = n) 
  
unsolved$unsolved <- rowSums(unsolved[,c("Closed without arrest","Open/No arrest")], na.rm=TRUE) 
  
  
unsolved <- unsolved %>% 
  select("city_name", "Closed by arrest", "unsolved")

#For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved, as well as the 95% confidence interval for this proportion. Print the output of the prop.test directly in your RMarkdown, and then save the output of prop.test as an R object and apply the tidy function from the broom package to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

baltimore <- unsolved %>% 
  subset(city_name == "Baltimore,MD") 

baltimore$n_cases <- rowSums(baltimore[,c("Closed by arrest","unsolved")])
